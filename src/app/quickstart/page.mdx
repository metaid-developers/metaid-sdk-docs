# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the MetaID SDK. We will cover how to install the SDK, connect to the wallet, fetch onchain data, and create your own data with the SDK. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>

A basic understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is required to use this SDK.
Let's get the code running!&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸš€

</Note>

## Installation

Choose your preferred JavaScript package manager to install the MetaID SDK package.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'NPM' }}
npm install @metaid/metaid
```

```bash {{ title: 'Yarn' }}
yarn add @metaid/metaid
```

```bash {{ title: 'PNPM' }}
pnpm add @metaid/metaid
```

```bash {{ title: 'Bun' }}
bun install @metaid/metaid
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaid/metaid"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    target="_blank"
  >
    <>Check out the package on NPM</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Configuration

No configuration is needed. The MetaID SDK is ready to use out of the box. ðŸŽ‰

## Let's build an onchain Twitter

### Connect to a wallet

The first step is to connect to a wallet. The MetaID SDK currently support [Metalet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lbjapbcmmceacocpimbpbidpgmlmoaao) wallet.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
import { connect, MetaletWallet } from '@metaid/metaid'

const chain = 'btc'
const wallet = await MetaletWallet.create({ chain })
const connector = connect(wallet)
```

`wallet` is an adapter instance that translates the wallet's API into a common interface that the MetaID SDK can use.
`connector` is responsible for managing the connection status to the wallet and handling the communication with it.

### Define a schema of the Tweet entity

Before we proceed with the implementation of our DApp, we need to define the schema for a tweet. This schema will determine the structure of each tweet object in our application.

<Note>It's basically equivalent to defining a table schema in a database.</Note>

```ts {{ title: 'src/entity-schemas/tweet.schema.ts' }}
import { type EntitySchema } from '@metaid/metaid'

const tweetSchema: EntitySchema = {
  name: 'tweet', // this is how we name our entity
  path: '/protocols/simpletweet', // this is the path where our entity will be stored on-chain
  versions: [
    // we talk about versioning later; right now let's just keep one version
    {
      version: 1,
      body: [
        // this is where we define the structure of our entity
        {
          name: 'content',
          type: 'string',
        },
        {
          name: 'attachments', // list of foreign keys to attaching file entities
          type: 'array',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### Use our schema to create an entity

What does an entity represent?

In the context of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) within database systems, a model typically corresponds to a table in the database. Similarly, within the MetaID SDK, an entity maps to specific on-chain data, allowing it to be constructed based on the schema defined.

What's even cooler is that we gain TypeScript's type safety for our entity data!

That being said, let's create our tweet entity.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
import { tweetSchema } from './entity-schemas/tweet.schema'

const Tweet = connector.load(tweetSchema)
```

Now we have `Tweet` entity, and we can use it to interact with the on-chain data.

### Get a tweet feed

Imagine we have a feed of tweets that we want to display in our DApp. We can fetch the tweets from the on-chain storage.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
const tweets = await Tweet.list({ limit: 10 })
```

OK, we just fetched the latest 10 tweets from BTC network. ðŸŽ‰ It's crazy how easy it is right?

Now image our user scrolls down and we want to fetch the next 10 tweets.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
const nextPage = await Tweet.list({ limit: 10, page: 2 })
const tweets = [...tweets, ...nextPage]
```

### Get one tweet and its content

Now let's say we want to display a single tweet with its content.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
const tweet = await Tweet.one({ id: 'tweet-id' })
console.log(tweet.content) // Hello MetaID!
```

### Post a new tweet

Finally, let's post a new tweet.

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
const newTweet = await Tweet.create({
  content: 'Hey Jude, dont make it bad...',
})
const idForJude = newTweet.id // This is the id that belongs to Jude.
```

### Oops! I'd like to delete my tweet

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
await Tweet.delete({ id: 'tweet-id' })
```

### What if I want to modify my tweet?

```ts {{ title: 'src/index.ts' }}
await Tweet.update({
  id: idForJude,
  content: 'Hey Jude, dont be afraid...',
})
```

That's it! You now know how to utilize `Entity` handler to interact with on-chain data. ðŸŽ‰
